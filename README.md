## Experiments
This repor
`model_list.py` contains original pytorch implementation on VGG and ResNet with the option using human designed pooling layers and our shape adaptors.
`training_joint.py` joint training method by update alpha and network weights together in the same step.
`training_alternate.py` joint training method by update alpha and network weights separately in the different step.
